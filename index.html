<p>I'm a second-year PhD student within the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/">Artificial Intelligence Group</a> of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory</a>, where I am devising cross-modal machine learning algorithms for multimodal data integration, supervised by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/">Prof Pietro Li&#242;</a> (with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/">Dr Mateja Jamnik</a> as my second adviser) and affiliated with <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk//">King's College</a>.</p>
<p>I graduated from the Computer Science Tripos at the University of Cambridge in 2016 with a First Class result and also hold an MPhil degree (with Distinction) in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, as of July 2017.</p>

<h2 id="work_exp">Work experience and other projects</h2>
<p>Research collaborations:</p>
<ul> <li>Summer 2018, <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/">Dr Aaron Courville</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software engineering internships:</p>
<ul> <li>July-September 2016, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/london/">Facebook London</a>, LogDevice team. I optimised client operations on a RocksDB database and implemented a new API required by another team in Facebook.</li>
 <li>July-September 2015, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/newyork/">Facebook New York</a>, iOS Product Infrastructure Team. I worked towards delivering a better experience for users of the Facebook iOS app. My project aimed to reduce the time taken to load content close to the area currently being viewed on screen, by improving the prioritization system for network requests.</li>
 <li>June-September 2014, <a href="https://careers.google.com/locations/zurich/">Google Zurich</a>, YouTube Uploads team. I added processing progress for video uploads on several YouTube pages, as the Upload page was the only one displaying this information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also took part in <a href="https://www.hackcambridge.com">Hack Cambridge</a>, winning third place in 2017. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/facejack">We showed</a> that you can trick a face recognition system quite easily, if you've got access to the neural network architecture!</p>

<h2 id="academic">Academic involvement</h2>
<p>Each year at the beginning of December, Cambridge colleges carry out admissions interviews for the Computer Science Tripos. This process can last anywhere between a few hours and a whole week(!!!), depending on the number of applicants. I have interviewed CST applicants in 2016 (for Murray Edwards College - a surreal experience, given that only 4 years before I was sat at the same desk, on the opposite side, during my own admissions interview :-)...) and in 2017 (for King's College).</p>
<p>Supervised the following Computer Science Tripos students for their Part II projects:</p>
<ul>  <li>Carlos Purves, <b>The PlayStation Reinforcement Learning Environment</b> (2018-19).</li>
  <li>Andrew Wells, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/archive/2018/aw684-dissertation.pdf"><b>Deep Learning for Music Recommendation</b></a> (2017-18) (76/100).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also supervise(d) the following undergraduate courses for Murray Edwards, King's, and Queens' Colleges:</p>
<ul>  <li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/ArtIntI/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (Easter '17, '19)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/Databases/">Databases</a> (Michaelmas '17, '18)</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/FoundsCS/">Foundations of Computer Science</a> (Michaelmas '16, '17, '18)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="ext_teach">External teaching</h2>
<p>I am a Machine Learning Teaching Fellow for <a href="https://cambridgespark.com/"><b>Cambridge Spark</b></a>. So far, I have taught the Neural Networks module from the Applied Data Science London Bootcamp.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Outside the department :-)</h2>
<p>At the start of my fourth year in Cambridge, I took up rowing and was a member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DarwinCollegeBoatClub/">Darwin College Boat Club</a> until October 2017, racing in Bumps as part of the Women's Second Boat. I'm currently training with the Women's First Boat in <a href="http://www.kingsboatclub.com/">King's College Boat Club</a>.</p>
<p>My relentless lifelong passion is music - I play piano and guitar, having been part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paperplaygroundband/">Paper Playground</a> (keyboards and backing vocals) ever since early 2017. We perform at pub gigs and the Open Mic nights in <a href="https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/">Darwin College</a>, having opened for its May Ball in 2017. In 2018, we also played at St John's May Ball.</p>
